        <p><strong>A startup studio</strong>, or venture development group, is a studio-like company supporting others&#x27; businesses through a model referred to as &quot;parallel entrepreneurship&quot;.</p>
        <blockquote><em>We work with you.</em></blockquote>
        <p>Startup studios are often mistaken with incubators, accelerators, or agencies.  These comparisons are apropos, though inaccurate, as the opportunity to work with a startup studio is different by way of <strong>three important criteria:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>1. Startup studios focus on new developments: startups, projects, or upcoming events.</strong></p>
        <p>Unlike startup incubators or venture capitalists, the main goal of a startup studio is to develop from the ground up. This implies an important involvement of time, dedication and resources for working operationally on the project for a period of time.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Startup studios build companies by following a repetitive process.</strong></p>
        <p>One focus of a startup studio is the rapid development and prototyping of new products. We work on multiple similar projects simultaneously, thereby leveraging the experience, audience, and resources of one to benefit another.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Startup studios build an infrastructure that enables an efficient venture-building process.</strong></p>
        <p>Startup studios own an infrastructure made of pooled resources: technical tools, management processes, and a multi-disciplinary team. By building several projects a year with the same team, we re-use this infrastructure, software assets and best practices across our work.</p>
        <p><strong>How We Work</strong></p>
        <p>The White Label is just that -- your team.  While not an incubator, our model is what&#x27;s considered an &quot;Incubator Studio&quot;. That is, a model that balances the costs of our team with a stake in your project.</p>
        <p>Our domain expertise lies in Media and Technology. Our practice-leaders in Development, Production, and Marketing support your work from the ground up. We are able to support, or completely provide, all you need throughout your engineering, marketing, and content production.   </p>
        <p>As you need it, we are your team, with experience and terms -- thanks to those technical tools and processes, a multi-disciplinary team with depth, and a network of peers and advisors in media.</p>
