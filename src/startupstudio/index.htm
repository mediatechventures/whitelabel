      <h1>The White Label Startup Studio</h1>
      <p>
        <b>A startup studio</b>, or venture development group, is a studio-like company supporting others' businesses through a model referred to as "parallel entrepreneurship".
      </p>
      <blockquote>We work with you.</blockquote>
      <p>
        Startup studios are often mistaken with incubators, accelerators, or agencies.  These comparisons are apropos, though inaccurate, as the opportunity to work with a startup studio is different by way of <b>three important criteria</b>:
      </p>
      <section class="numbered">
        <div>
          <label>Startup studios focus on new developments: startups, projects, or upcoming events.</label>
          <p>
            Unlike startup incubators or venture capitalists, the main goal of a startup studio is to develop from the ground up. This implies an important involvement of time, dedication and resources for working operationally on the project for a period of time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>Startup studios build companies by following a repetitive process.</label>
          <p>
            One focus of a startup studio is the rapid development and prototyping of new products. We work on multiple similar projects simultaneously, thereby leveraging the experience, audience, and resources of one to benefit another.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <label>Startup studios build an infrastructure that enables an efficient venture-building process.</label>
          <p>
            Startup studios own an infrastructure made of pooled resources: technical tools, management processes, and a multi-disciplinary team. By building several projects a year with the same team, we re-use this infrastructure, software assets and best practices across our work.
